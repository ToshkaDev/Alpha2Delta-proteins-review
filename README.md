# Alpha2Delta-proteins-review

For molecular docking, AlphaFold models of human Alpha2/Delta-2 to Alpha2/Delta-4 proteins were used. The file **Alpha2Delta1-4_structural_analysis.pdb** shows the structurally superimposed ligand-binding pockets of Alpha2/Delta-1 to Alpha2/Delta-4 proteins. The parameters used for molecular docking are shown below. 

### Alpha2/Delta-2.

Structural model docked with ligands - file **AF_alpha2delta2_with_docked_ligands.pdb**. 

Coordinates of the center of the simulation box (Angstroms):
X: -18.648; Y: -7.543; Z: 2.569
The box dimensions (Angstroms):
X: 22; Y: 22; Z: 20

Alpha2/Delta-2 was found to bind all gabapentinoids used for docking (gabapentin, pregabalin, and mirogabalin), GABA, and proteinogenic amino acids. Tryptophan binds with low affinity and its binding is energetically less favorable.


### Alpha2/Delta-3.

Structural model docked with ligands - file **AF_alpha2delta3_with_docked_ligands.pdb**.

Coordinates of the center of the simulation box (Angstroms):
X: -9.914; Y: -10.032; Z: 3.116
The box dimensions (Angstroms):
X: 24; Y: 24; Z: 22

Alpha2/Delta-3 was found to bind Alanine, Aspartate, GABA, Glycine, Serine, Threonine, and Valine.

### Alpha2/Delta-4.

Structural model docked with ligands - file **AF_alpha2delta4_with_docked_ligands.pdb**.

Coordinates of the center of the simulation box (Angstroms):
X: 17.871; Y: -12.004; Z: -2.837
The box dimensions (Angstroms):
X: 22; Y: 24; Z: 24

Alpha2/Delta-4 was found to bind Alanine, GABA, Glycine, and Valine. Threonine binds with low affinity and its binding is energetically less favorable.
